The University of Sheffield and University of Sheffield co-founded **OxShef: dataviz** in late 2017 to provide open source tutorials and advice to researchers on using interactive data visualisations to promote engagement directly with datasets and to broaden research impact.

[ORDA](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/rdm/orda) is University of Sheffield's insitutional repository and provides advice and support to researchers on research data management and the hosting of research datasets. ORDA also provides specialist support in the use of interactive data visualisations. To contact the ORDA team please email us at <rse@sheffield.ac.uk> and we'll get back to you ASAP to arrange a meeting.

**OxShef: dataviz** resources are designed to be of general use to all academics, however there is dedicated support available to University of Sheffield researchers and academics detailed below.

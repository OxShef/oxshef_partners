The University of Oxford and University of Sheffield co-founded **OxShef: dataviz** in late 2017 to provide open source tutorials and advice to researchers on using interactive data visualisations to promote engagement directly with datasets and to broaden research impact.

Oxford's contribution to the project is spearheaded by Academic IT Research Support from IT Services and the [Interactive Data Network](http://idn.it.ox.ac.uk){target='_blank'}.

**OxShef: dataviz** resources are designed to be of general use to all academics, however there is dedicated support available to University of Oxford researchers and academics detailed below.
